# Code Refactoring- HTML & CSS

HTML Refactoring:
For the HTML refactoring on this page I ended up changing all HTML elements from the page into semantic elements. This made it so the browser has an easier time finding the important information, and so that the code is easier to read.

CSS Refactoring:
For the CSS refactoring on the page, it was taking all of the different CSS elements that were doing the same thing and consolidating them. This makes our CSS page far easier see what elements are effecting what. This also made it more exact to which elements were actually changing.

Reason for Refactoring:
The reason that this page needed to be refactored was it had to many HTML elements that had no real meaning. In giving the HTML document more semantic elements it makes it easier for the browser to find what it needs. Making the CSS document more consolidated means that it will be able to make more exact changes. Plus it is far easier to read.
